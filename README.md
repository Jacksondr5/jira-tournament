This is an app that will help you effort tickets for your team when you don't have a well-established effort scale. It pits each ticket against each other to produce a ranking of the tickets. This ranking can be used to help you estimate the effort of the tickets.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
